All exercises must be solved using recursive functions. Tests must be written in the main function to verify that the implemented functions are correct. The use of auxiliary functions is allowed, provided they are recursive. If recursive auxiliary functions are used, then the main function may be non-recursive, as long as it calls the recursive auxiliary function. In any case, loop statements are strictly forbidden in both the main and auxiliary functions. The use of global variables, static variables, or any similar mechanism for sharing memory across recursive function calls is not allowed. Whenever a modification of the data structure is required, the implementation must be considered as having side effects. Memory occupied by deleted nodes must be explicitly freed.
